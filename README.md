# JS-Number-Guessing-Game
a number guessing game with five difficulties I coded using JavaScript.

this took me 500 lines of code to make

in other words, there are probably simpler ways to do this

but this way is the easiest way for me to do this

i hope the readability of the code is understandable

Anyways...

You're welcome to download and edit the code to your liking

You're also welcome to request a pull from me. If it's something to improve the code readability or
shoerten the code by A LOT then I'd obviously accept.
